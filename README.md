# MSAI-AI6126-Advanced-Computer-Vision

There are two Homeworks, two kaggle competitions, one recorded presentation and one quiz in this module.

The first competition is regarding face parsing using Celeb-A datasets. https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html Our task is to train a model and test it
on a testing datasets in Kaggle. The rank is sorted by the mIOU. 

The second competition is regarding super resolution. We are only allowed to use Network that does not exceed ~160k (Estimated) parameters. Our task is to train a model and test it on a low quality testing datasets in Kaggle. For this competition, I use SRResnet. The rank is sorted by PSNR. Additional bonus mark will be given if we can produce a super resolution image on the five given real wolrd LQ images using SRGAN with the pretrained SRResnet model. As we know, PSNR is not a reliable metrics to determine the quality of the image. Therefore, even if the image has a very good quality especially generated by GAN will always have a low PSNR value.
